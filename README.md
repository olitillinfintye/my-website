## ðŸš¨ About this repo (please read!)

You can use this code for your own website, but please with attribution ðŸ˜Š.

Please note that the design of the website is inspired from "brittanychiang.com", but didn't copied even a single piece of code from brittanyching repo, However, i built the portfolio from scratch with different technolgoies, like `Tailwind CSS` and `Framer Motion` and i added some other functionalities to it, so it might seems the same, but believe me i did a lot of work the code, website and how it works is entirely different!!!!. If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Next.js DOCS](https://nextjs.org/docs) same thing for Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion check out the Documentation, Or you can simply reach to me directly.


I'd like to highlight that the `This website can't be reached` trick featured on my portfolio is an `original idea` and not borrowed from any other source. It's intended as a playful element, reflecting my sense of humor. While I acknowledge that it might not be the most user-friendly approach, it's worth mentioning that my portfolio receives an average of 30-10 daily visitors. Through careful observation, I've calculated that the average reaction time is 2 seconds before users realize the playful nature of the message, at which point the content becomes accessible. It's a quirky touch meant to add a lighthearted element to the user experience.

## Description

Without a doubt a portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. Itâ€™s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. However, Why why did i choose Next.js? Because it is a React framework with Server-Side Rendering, which is good for SEO (Good for us if we get found on Google, right?).

Also, Next.js helps us build a full back-end & blazing-fast websites along with benefits such as Image optimization.

Why tailwindcss? Because TailwindCSS is a framework which reduces a lot of styling efforts. It has low level CSS classes that you can directly embed into the HTML code.
